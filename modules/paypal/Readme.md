## Requirements

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has mandated that early versions of
TLS be retired from service. All organizations that handle credit card information
are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, PayPal has
upgraded its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections.
Connections to the sandbox environment use only TLS 1.2.

For more official, relevant information, see the 2017-2018 Merchant Security
Roadmap Microsite:
* [TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade Microsite][4]
* [SSL Certificate Upgrade Microsite][5]

Check the version of your URLâ€™s underlying security library. If you use OpenSSL
libraries, please update them to at least version 1.0.1c.
